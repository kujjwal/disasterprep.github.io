              <h2>Introduction:</h2>
              <p>Contemporary US Disaster Preparedness policies suffer from a variety of issues</p>
            </div>
            <p>
              Many of these issues have been brought to light in past decades, but still very little has been done to combat the inequities existing in US disaster policy. 
              For instance, many of the same issues with unequal support stratified based on race exist today, with current disaster infrastructure not updated to combat structural
              inequalities that exist between different racial or socioeconomic groups. For the vast majority of individuals who live in less affluent areas, natural disasters are much
              more significant and devastating than for those who are afforded resources and support in affluent areas. Another similar problem relates to the bureaucratic and inefficient nature
              of FEMA, which has historically struggled to manage its budget and efficiently allocating resources for natural disasters. 
            </p>
            <p>
              With past examples such as Hurricane Katrina, Puerto Rico, and Hurricane Harvey, it is critical to examine the central role that FEMA and US Disaster Preparedness policies
              play in impacting the lives of many around the country. While FEMA and the US Government have continued to fall short in their efforts to mitigate catastrophes, there are potential 
              solutions that could assist in creating efficient and cost-effective disaster management practices. Below, we have analyzed some of the main causes of poor 
              disaster management practices, statistical analysis of their efficacy, and finally offer some potential solutions.

          <h2>Analysis</h2>
          <p>Causes of Poor Natural Disaster Preparation Practices</p>
        </div>

        <div class="row">

          <div class="col-lg-4">

              <h4>Structural Violence</h4>
              <p>Many instances of historical FEMA disaster management have been marked with a level of structural racism - where individuals of certain racial groups 
                or of certain socioeconomic tiers are afforded fewer resources, less access to necessary services, and are funneled less capital for community redevelopment. 
                Specifically, this issue most clearly came up with the shortcomings of US catastrophe management in Hurricane Katrina, where primarily minority areas were flooded 
                and given fewer resources than regions saturated with white individuals or regions with higher socioeconomic status. This same problem occurred again with Hurricanes 
                Maria and Harvey, where similarly low-income and largely minority regions were accorded fewer resources and had worse infrastructure set up for mitigating natural disasters.
                These issues share a common thread in that FEMA and US disaster policy writ large are written to favor areas of higher "status", where individuals with more affluence 
                are correspondingly given more provisions and support during natural disasters. This issue of blanket structural violence in disaster management most clearly highlights 
                one of the major shortcomings in FEMA and US Disaster policy, which must be made to equitably treat individuals who suffer from natural disasters without discriminating 
                based on class or race. 
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="col-lg-4 mt-4 mt-lg-0">
            <div class="box" data-aos="zoom-in" data-aos-delay="200">
              <span>02</span>
              <h4>Funding and resource allocation</h4>
              <p>Another issue with US Disaster Policy is its lackluster resource allocation policies. Much of FEMA aid goes to small state disasters even when states have 
                excess capital or surpluses for disaster management. This approach to disaster management quickly exhausts FEMA capital, and thus US disaster aid often lacks 
                the capital to assist with large-scale disasters. One specific instance of this problem occurring is with both Hurricane Maria and Hurricane Harvey occurring in 
                relatively the same time period – causing FEMA to be spread thin without capital and funding, leading to minimal aid, understaffed shelters, and overall poor 
                disaster control practices following both hurricanes. Additionally, FEMA faced many issues with poor planning and execution, such as sending incorrect disaster supply 
                orders, failing to develop a system of communication with broken cell towers, and lacking the manpower and resources to install critical infrastructure like generators 
                and electrical grids to redevelop the regions in Puerto Rico affected most by Hurricane Maria. Similar issues occurred with Hurricane Katrina and Harvey, where the US 
                aid packages did not account for broken infrastructure such as levees and dams in New Orleans, and thus the aid effort was greatly slowed. Moving forward, FEMA and US 
                Disaster policy must be executed and planned better, starting with greater funding, manpower, and policy changes to improve efficiency.

              <span>03</span>
              <h4>Bureaucratic Partnerships</h4>
              <p>Many historical shortcomings of FEMA and US disaster management have been based on bureaucratic issues with visibility and structure regarding disaster policy. 
                With many legal and political challenges on state and federal aid, as well as complex regulations on disaster assistance, many existing policies regarding disaster 
                management are largely outmoded and only lengthen already inefficient disaster preparedness and management practices. Specifically, many issues with Hurricane Maria 
                and Katrina were underpinned by an inability to obtain the correct supplies or ration correct portions of food, water, or emergency housing. These problems often stemmed from 
                miscommunications between private entities and government organizations such as FEMA, causing structural gridlock and lengthening the time it would take to resolve many 
                disasters. In the future, this process of communication between public governmental entities and private corporations must be greatly simplified, and the regulations for disaster preparedness 
                and management must be made with the goal of rapid catastrophe management as current FEMA approaches and US policies are weakened by gridlock and disorganization – wasting 
                precious time which could be used to help save lives impacted by natural disasters.

                    <h3>FEMA Available Workers</h3>
                    <p>Confirming our analysis above, FEMA available worker numbers have been somewhat stagnating, and clearly cannot assist with all damages in many areas. With near 4000-5000 workers, current worker numbers are not equipped to handle large scale disasters, or even multiple disasters at once, leading to lackluster disaster aid.</p>

                  <div class="col-lg-8 details order-2 order-lg-1">
                    <h3>Federal Costs</h3>
                    <p>Similarly confirming our analysis, the federal costs of FEMA are spread out through the United States in even minor regions, and costs quickly escalate on the federal level. Especially since many natural disasters are often covered by federal aid instead of state aid (however small), capital allocated for FEMA gets quickly depleted even for small natural disasters. In this sense, FEMA's gridlock is caused much more by a thousand cuts from small disasters than from large infrequent disasters. </p>

                    <h3>Federal Response Frequency</h3>
                    <p>Similar to the previous graph, the federal response frequency for minor events is much greater than what one would expect from FEMA. To eliminate some issues with FEMA disaster preparedness inefficiencies, FEMA resources should be concentrated on natural disasters with great magnitude, while smaller natural disasters can be managed by states with budget surpluses. As this graph confirms, FEMA responses are too frequent in low-risk areas, causing gridlock when natural disasters of high magnitude arise.</p>

                  <p>
                    Hurricane Katrina is one of the most famous instances of the shortcomings of US disaster preparedness policy. Many issues of structural violence were 
                    brought to light in regards to how the disaster was being managed and resources were being distributed inequitably, and many issues with existing infrastructure 
                    such as the levees and dams were also brought to light. As one of the greatest instigators for change in federal disaster policy, Hurricane Katrina spurred a movement 
                    for both improved civil rights and stricter governmental action to improve natural disaster preparation across the United States.

                  <p>
                    Hurricane Maria is also a well-known example of the shortcomings of US disaster preparation and management. Specifically, many issues with routing necessary supplies, 
                    finding generators, and rapidly developing emergency housing and makeshift medical centers all stemmed from problems in working with private distributors and government 
                    regulation on distribution, as well as with a lack of funding due to Hurricane Harvey at roughly the same time period. Additionally, many Americans felt much less compelled 
                    to provide aid given that much of the affected area was in Puerto Rico, which draws on parallels between the lackluster aid provided to African Americans in New Orleans and 
                    the lackluster aid and donations provisioned to Puerto Ricans. Continuing this trend, we see these same issues with FEMA aid arise in multiple natural disasters.

                    Although Hurricane Andrew is a less known example, it is one of the first instances where US disaster policy shortcomings were fully exposed. With gridlock even 
                    worse than Hurricane Maria, many residents of Southern Florida were left for days without food, running water, and electricity, as FEMA had to engage with many political 
                    barriers before being allowed to provide aid and assistance to US citizens. Even after obtaining approval, the process to fly out supplies, create temporary housing, and 
                    redevelop the affected regions was arduous and inefficient as FEMA had much less capital for natural disasters and had to engage with private entities which were unwilling 
                    to negotiate pricing. At the time, Hurricane Andrew was the most costly natural disaster for the United States by far, and similar to the other two historical events mentioned, 
                    served to highlight the underlying issues with the structure and governmental policies surrounding federal disaster preparedness and aid.

                  One solution would be to develop a system of identifying differentiated risk based on race and socioeconomic factors in areas with high risk for natural disaster. This would entail analyzing the infrastructure and budgetary concerns in many regions throughout the US which are at risk for natural disaster, but is a critically important step in US disaster policy development as it will help us identify the weaknesses and strengths of our current disaster infrastructure, and can help assist with resource allocation in any future natural disasters. Further, this approach would ensure that disaster preparation and aid are distributed equitably, an important measure for helping rebuild torn communities, and preserving a sense of moral decency which prior disaster management such as Hurricane Katrina lacked. This approach would be founded on statistical analysis of areas with high risk, and would only entail needing to analyze the structural integrity of existing disaster infrastructure, and if necessary, replacing any infrastructure which could cause problems in the future. This approach would also help save money in the long-term, as replacing weak parts of natural disaster infrastructure would ensure that future natural disasters are kept contained and only minimally damage communities.

                  Another solution based on statistical data regarding healthcare worker psychology is that with a limited supply of healthcare workers, it is possible to use statistical modelling to help understand the psychology of healthcare workers and their optimal placement in certain natural disaster situations. With enough data and with a limited supply of workers, this novel approach to statistical modelling would greatly help optimize the allocation of resources by FEMA by sending workers only to their optimal working areas, and ensuring that fixing natural disasters occurs in the quickest manner possible. Especially with the issue that there are only limited supplies of healthcare and FEMA workers, finding a way to use statistics and mathematics to model the response and abilities of healthcare workers is critically important to ensure that FEMA and US disaster policies are optimized in the future. By using this statistical approach, FEMA can better improve their policies surrounding natural disasters, and can help compensate for their limited supply of workers by making the time spent my each worker optimized, based on their past experiences, abilities, and psychology.

                  One final solution would be to develop a system of communication between public and private entities specifically for natural disaster management tasks. Specifically, natural disasters often require the bulk ordering of supplies to ensure the rapid redevelopment and support of impacted communities – items such as radios, batteries, generators, tents, and other essential materials would need to be bulk ordered and ordered quickly. Status quo policies require FEMA and public government entities to interface with private corporations, causing a great deal of bureaucratic regulation and logistics and thus slowing down the aid effort. Instead, having a direct pipeline of communication to ensure that FEMA and other US disaster prevention authorities are able to bulk order supplies or interface simply with private entities would greatly help in improving the efficiency and rapidity of natural disaster preparedness. Confirmed by the statistics above, many problems with natural disaster aid stem from a lack of efficiency in obtaining essential materials in the precious few hours or days following a natural disaster. With such a communication pipeline and relaxed government regulations on supply and delivery following natural disaster, the process of response and provisioning aid will become much quicker.
